# loginForm

Simple Login form with dummy users. The frontend and backend are in seperate node.js projects. The frontend is a webpack react project and the backend is purely express with other helpful packages.

Feel free to use the code as you wish but it will not work out of the box on your machine as I made it to work on my website. If you wish to test it out go to http://loginprofile.syntaxiscs.com

Thanks for checking this out!
